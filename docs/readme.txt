This Lent I will show my love for Jesus by doing something for him each day. To show what I have done, I will color a cross each day to match one of the good deeds below.

Actions:
Green Cross - I said an extra prayer for Jesus
Purple Cross - I helped someone for Jesus
Red Cross - I did something good that was hard for me to do for Jesus
Yellow Cross - I did what I was supposed to do without being told for Jesus

Jobin is prayerful.

Jobin helped someone in need.

Jobin bettered himself by doing something that was previously hard

Jobin did his part without being told

Story is all about "Action and its Reward"
Action is a cross --> Reward is Easter
